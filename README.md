## One Of My Very First Sites!

- I was the only one working on the project.
- The page uses languages such as HTML, CSS, JS
- There is an adaptive with elements for user convenience, such as "Burger Menu",
  "Navigation buttons with an accordion effect", "Adaptive blocks", "Fixed menu with navigation buttons" smooth animations are also added to each block and so on.
